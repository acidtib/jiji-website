# Introduction

Jiji is a lightweight container deployment orchestration tool designed to deploy containerized applications across multiple servers with simplicity, speed, and portability.

## Why Jiji?

- **Zero-Downtime Deployments** - Health checks and automatic rollback ensure your services stay available
- **Multi Server Support** - Deploy across multiple servers with parallel SSH execution
- **Container Engine Agnostic** - Works with Docker or Podman
- **Private Networking** - WireGuard mesh VPN with encrypted inter-server communication
- **Service Discovery** - Automatic DNS resolution for service-to-service communication
- **Simple Configuration** - YAML-based configuration-as-code

## Core Components

### Jiji CLI

The main orchestration tool built on Deno/TypeScript. Handles building, deploying, and managing containerized applications across your infrastructure.

### jiji-dns

A lightweight DNS server that provides automatic service discovery for containers. Enables services to communicate using friendly names like `myproject-api.jiji` instead of IP addresses.

### Network Stack

- **WireGuard** - Encrypted peer-to-peer mesh VPN between servers
- **Corrosion** - Distributed CRDT database for service registration
- **kamal-proxy** - HTTP/HTTPS routing with SSL termination

## Quick Example

```yaml
# .jiji/deploy.yml
project: myapp

builder:
  engine: docker
  registry:
    type: local

servers:
  web1:
    host: server1.example.com
  web2:
    host: server2.example.com

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    hosts: [web1, web2]
    proxy:
      app_port: 3000
      host: api.example.com
      ssl: true
      healthcheck:
        path: /health
```

```bash
# Bootstrap the servers
jiji server init
```

```bash
# Deploy with zero downtime
jiji deploy --build
```
