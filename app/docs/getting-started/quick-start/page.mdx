# Quick Start

This guide walks you through deploying your first application with Jiji.

## 1. Create Configuration

Initialize Jiji in your project:

```bash
jiji init
```

Edit `.jiji/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
project: myapp

builder:
  engine: docker
  local: true
  registry:
    type: local

ssh:
  user: deploy

servers:
  web1:
    host: server1.example.com

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    hosts:
      - web1
    proxy:
      app_port: 3000
      host: myapp.example.com
      ssl: true
      healthcheck:
        path: /health
        interval: 10s
        timeout: 5s
```

## 2. Initialize Servers

Set up your servers with the required components:

```bash
jiji server init
```

## 3. Setup Registry

Configure your container registry:

```bash
jiji registry setup
```

## 4. Build and Deploy

Deploy your application:

```bash
# Build and deploy in one command
jiji deploy --build

# Or separately
jiji build
jiji deploy
```

## 5. Verify Deployment

Check your services:

```bash
# View logs
jiji services logs

# Check service status on servers
jiji server exec "docker ps"
```

## What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Phase** - Container image is built locally or remotely
2. **Push Phase** - Image is pushed to the configured registry
3. **Deploy Phase**:
   - Old container keeps running
   - New container starts alongside
   - Health checks run until ready
   - Proxy routes traffic to new container
   - Old container is stopped and removed
4. **Cleanup** - Old images are pruned (keeping recent versions)

## Environment-Specific Deployments

Create environment-specific configs:

```bash
# .jiji/deploy.yml        - base config
# .jiji/deploy.staging.yml - staging overrides
# .jiji/deploy.production.yml - production overrides
```

Deploy to a specific environment:

```bash
jiji deploy -e staging
jiji deploy -e production
```
